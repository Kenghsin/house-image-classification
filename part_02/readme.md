# Part 2

Due: March 9, 2018

### Overview

In this section you will update us on your project, including the project you have chosen, an extensive outline of EDA and modeling to date, the goal of your predictive model, and the data you will use to explore that model. 

**Your data must be fully in hand by this point OR you must have a solid, achievable plan to do so that has been communicated to your local instructor.**

### Requirements

We expect a formatted and complete Jupyter Notebook by end of class on March 9, 2018 which accomplishes the following:

- Identifies which of the three proposals you outlined in your lightning talk you have chosen
- Articulates the main goal of your project
- Outlines your proposed methods and models
- Defines the risks & assumptions of your data 
- Revises initial goals & success criteria, as needed
- Documents your data source
- Performs & summarizes preliminary EDA of your data

### Data Guidelines

What should you thinking about and looking for as you collect your capstone data?

- Source and format your data
  - Have a way to save data locally (e.g., SQL or CSV), especially if scraping from the web or collecting from an API.
  - Create a data dictionary to accompany your data.
- Perform initial cleaning and munging.
  - Organize your data relevant to your project goals.
  - Write functions to automatically clean and munge data as necessary.
  - Take copious notes, for both others and yourself, describing your assumptions and approach.


### EDA Guidelines

Think about the following as you perform your initial EDA.

- Identify the data types you are working with.
- Examine the distributions of your data, numerically and/or visually.
- Identify outliers.
- Identify missing data and look for patterns of missing data.
- Describe how your EDA will inform your modeling decisions and process.

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

 Materials must be presented in a Jupyter Notebook stored within a repository on your personal (*not* GA) GitHub. Please submit a link to this repository by the due date ([submission link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScez-8PsyIgP548fNtsoDpuNTdKxsr6tVvKPDtbr-mQov6NCw/viewform?usp=sf_link)).
 
### BONUS

- Create roadmap of your project with milestones.
- Write a blog post on what you learned from your EDA.
