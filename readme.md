# Capstone Project

Your Capstone project is the culmination of your time at GA. You will be tasked with developing an interesting question, collecting the data required to model that data, developing the strongest model (or models) for prediction, and communicating those findings to other data scientists and non-technical individuals. This introductory document lays out the five consitutent portions of the project and their due dates.

## Your Deliverables

- A well-made predictive model using either structured or unstructured machine learning techniques (or other technique approved in advanced by the global instructors), as well as clean, well-written code. 
- A technical report aimed at fellow data scientists that explains your process and findings
- A public presentation of your findings aimed at laypeople. 

### **[Capstone, Part 1: Capstone Topic + Dataset Validation](./part_01/)**

In Part 1, get started by choosing **three potential topics and problems**, describing your goals & criteria for success, potential audience(s), and identifying 1-2 potential datasets. You will present this information in a slide deck, and should be prepared to answer questions and defend your data selection(s). Presentations should take no more than 3-5 minutes.

**The ultimate choice of topic for your capstone project is yours!** However, this is research and development work. Sometimes projects that look easy can be difficult and vice versa. It never hurts to have a second (or third) option available.

- **Goal**: Prepare a 3-5 minute lightning talk that covers three potential topics, including potential sources of data and 
- **Due**: October 27, 2017 (Friday)

### **[Capstone, Part 2: Problem Statement + EDA](./part_02/)**

For Part 2, provide an overview of your approach to solving the problem you've chosen. Summarize your objectives, goals & success metrics, and any risks & assumptions. Outline your proposed methods and models, perform your initial EDA, and summarize the process. **Your data should be in hand by this point in the process!**

#### Again, your data should be in hand by this point the process!

- **Goal**: Describe your proposed approach and summarize your initial EDA in a code submission to your local instructor (submit a link to your repository [here](https://goo.gl/forms/W4cU06SjDmX1MMnd2))
- **Due**: November 15, 2017 (Wednesday)

### **[Capstone, Part 3: Progress Report + Preliminary Findings](./part_03/)**

In Part 3, you'll create a progress report of your work in order to get feedback along the way. Describe your approach, initial results, and any setbacks or lessons learned so far. Your report should include updated visual and statistical analysis of your data. Youâ€™ll also meet with your local instructional team to get feedback on your results so far!

- **Goal**: Discuss progress and setbacks, include visual and statistical analysis, review with instructor. Submit your progress report [here](https://goo.gl/forms/52JPjyuazVumztZM2)
- **Due**: November 29, 2017 (Wednesday)

### **[Capstone, Part 4: Report Writeup + Technical Analysis](./part_04/)**

By now, you're ready to apply your modeling skills to make machine learning predictions. Your goal for Part 4 is to develop a technical document that can be shared among your peers.

Document your research with a summary, explaining your modeling approach as well as the strengths and weaknesses of any variables in the process. You should provide insight into your analysis, using best practices like cross validation or applicable prediction metrics.

- **Goal**: Detailed report and code with a summary of your statistical analysis, model, and evaluation metrics.
- **Due**: December 18, 2017 (Monday)

### **[Capstone, Part 5: Presentation + Recommendations](./part_05/)**

Whether during an interview or as part of a job, you will frequently have to present your findings to business partners and other interested parties - many of whom won't know anything about data science! That's why for Part 5, you'll create a presentation of your previous findings with a non-technical audience in mind.

You should already have the analytical work complete, so now it's time to clean up and clarify your findings. Come up with a detailed slide deck or interactive demo that explains your data, visualizes your model, describes your approach, articulates strengths and weaknesses, and presents specific recommendations. Be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience!

- **Goal**: Detailed presentation deck that relates your data, model, and findings to a non-technical audience.
- **Due**: December 20, 2017 (Wednesday)
