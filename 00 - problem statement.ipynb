    "# Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "When I receive real estate listing notification from my realtor, I probability look at some basic information such as price, house pictures, bedrooms, bathrooms..., etc. Except price, the first impression of a house is more important than other information. If I look at house pictures then I don't like it, it doesn't matter many bedrooms, bathrooms...etc, the house have. \n",
    "\n",
    "As show in figure, the strategy of my realtor is to sending me all the houses with price under some threshold, then let me check if there any houses I like. As you can see, it is a lot of houses ot check. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, he sometimes sends me message \"*there is a house you might be interested in, we can go checking it on sunday*\". **How does my realtor know I probably like this house?** It might because we do house hunting for two years together, so he learned. According to this situation, can I use mechine learning algorithm to build a image classification system to classify the house images which I might like, then filter those houses with price under some threshold, the system tells me some house I might be interested in, like my realtor do? So, my strategy is shown in figure.\n",

    "\n",
    "If this system works, instead of checking every house with price under setting threshold, I just need to check price of all the houses system tells me. It can svae me a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The main challenge of this problem would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Insufficient data`: it doesn't make sense to ask someone watch more than 300 images.\n",
    "2. `Image quailty`: every home owner takes pictures in different angle, different layout. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I need to go through several steps:\n",
    "1. Obtain data: the features of data will contain house images, number of bedroom, number of bathroom, house size, lot size, price, city name. Please check `1 web-scraping.jpynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data cleaning: Please check `2 data-cleaning.jpynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Image preprocessing: Please check `3 image-preprocessing.jpynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. EDA: Please check `4 eda.jpynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model: Logistic Six classification models which is regression, decision tree, random forest, KNN, SVM, and gradient boosting are used to classify this binary class like and unlike. Please check `5 model-classification`. A CNN model is built to classify this binary class like and unlike. Please check `5 model-cnn`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evaluate model:\n",

    "Everything looks like very good work. While it is unfortunate that you were not able to prove that this task can be done, I think it is still a very interesting problem to have worked on to show the limitations of CNN technology, and the requirements that you might constrain future work to. Make sure to reference this in your technical write and please check in with me once it is properly formatted and pushed to github. "
