    "# Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "When I receive real estate listing notification from my realtor, I probability look at some basic information such as price, house pictures, bedrooms, bathrooms..., etc. Except price, the first impression of a house is more important than other information. If I look at house pictures then I don't like it, it doesn't matter many bedrooms, bathrooms...etc, the house have. \n",
    "\n",
    "As show in figure, the strategy of my realtor is to sending me all the houses with price under some threshold, then let me check if there any houses I like. As you can see, it is a lot of houses ot check. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, he sometimes sends me message \"*there is a house you might be interested in, we can go checking it on sunday*\". **How does my realtor know I probably like this house?** It might because we do house hunting for two years together, so he learned. According to this situation, can I use mechine learning algorithm to build a image classification system to classify the house images which I might like, like my realtor do? My strategy is shown in figure.\n",

    "\n",
    "If this system works, I only need to check the houses which filter by system. It can svae me a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The main challenge of this problem would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insufficient data**: it doesn't make sense to ask someone watch more than 300 images.\n",
    "2. **Image quailty**: every home owner takes pictures in different angle, different layout. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem solving prcoess\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, here are seven steps for problem solving process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Gather data: \n",
    "- Scrap data of sold houses in city of EL CERRITO, EL SOBRANTE, HERCULES, PINOLE, SAN PABLO\n",
    "- The scraped data includes house images, number of bedroom, number of bathroom, house size, lot size, price, city name. \n",
    "- Save file to city_sold.csv, such as `pinole_sold.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Please check `1 web-scraping.jpynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data cleaning: \n",
    "- Clean each data then save file to city_sold_clean.csv such as `pinole_sold_clean.csv`\n",
    "- Merge data of five cities to `sold_clean.csv` \n",
    "\n",
    "Please check `2 data-cleaning.jpynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Image preprocessing: \n",
    "\n",
    "Separately images to three categories, can not use, like, and unlike.\n",
    "\n",
    "The width/height ratios of most images are shown in figure. Majority of width/height ratios are around 1.5.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/Kenghsin/house-image-classification/blob/master/assets/w/h_ratio_all.png\" width=\"1052\" height=\"279\" /><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistic of image size are shown in figure, the smallest height of iamges is 105. According to the majority of width/height ratios and smallest height of images, all images are resized to 150 * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/Kenghsin/house-image-classification/blob/master/assets/eda_images.png\" width=\"528\" height=\"140\" /><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manually remove images which is not clear or not a house imge\n",
    "- Manually label image to `like` and `unlike`\n",
    "- Remove image which the width/height ratio is not between 1 and 2\n",
    "- Resize pixel of image to 150 * 100\n",
    "- Convert image to pixel\n",
    "- Merge house features and image pixel\n",
    "- Svae file to city150X100.csv, such as `pinole150X100.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Please check `3 image-preprocessing.jpynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. EDA: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please check `4 eda.jpynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Model: \n",
    "- Logistic Six classification models which is regression, decision tree, random forest, KNN, SVM, and gradient boosting are used to classify this binary class like and unlike. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please check `5 model-classification`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A CNN model is built to classify this binary class like and unlike. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please check `5 model-cnn`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Evaluate model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Answer the problem: \n",
    "- The precision is 83.8%. For every 100 listings, the improvement is 16%.\n",
    "- It is still a very interesting problem to have worked on to show the limitations of CNN technology\n",

    "Everything looks like very good work. While it is unfortunate that you were not able to prove that this task can be done, I think it is still a very interesting problem to have worked on to show the limitations of CNN technology, and the requirements that you might constrain future work to. Make sure to reference this in your technical write and please check in with me once it is properly formatted and pushed to github. "
